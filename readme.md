# How to Add Files to This Exam Archive

Welcome to the **FindMypapers** repository! This project powers a website that allows students to easily find and access past exam papers.

To ensure the website displays the correct files, it's essential to upload them to the right location within this repository. This guide will walk you through the simple steps.

### Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Folder

The website is designed to look for exam files in a specific directory. All your PDFs should be uploaded to the `media` directory.

> From the main page of this repository, click on the `media` folder.

### Step 2: Upload Your Files

Once you are inside the `media` directory, you can easily upload files directly from your computer.

1. Navigate to the directory you would like to upload your folder (e.g. `media/Year 11/Math Advanced (2U)/Yearly papers/`)
  
2.  Click the **"Add file"** dropdown menu.

3.  Select **"Upload files"**.

4.  You can either drag and drop your PDF files into the designated area or click **"choose your files"** to select them from your computer.

### Step 3: Commit Your Changes

After uploading your files, you need to save them to the repository.

1.  At the bottom of the page, a "Commit changes" section will appear.

2.  Add a short, descriptive commit message, like "Added 2024 Maths Adv paper."

3.  Click the green **"Commit changes"** button.

That's it! The website will automatically detect your newly added files, and once approved by a maintainer will be visible.

**Pro-Tips for Organizing Files:**

* **Use Descriptive Names:** Name your files clearly (e.g., `2024_HSC_English_Paper_1.pdf`) to make them easy to find.

* **Create New Folders:** If you want to organize by subject or year, you can create new folders within the `media` directory.
